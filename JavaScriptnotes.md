@daniel_johnston: if codeacademy javascript is making you lose the will, you might find this an interesting alternative: https://pragprog.com/book/csjava/3d-game-programming-for-kids

BTW, I think my personal preference for ranking up on JavaScript is just repeatedly doing JavaScript katas on http://www.codewars.com/ and using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript to look up all the new methods

Mozilla Developer Network
JavaScript
JavaScript Â® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, most known as the scripting language for Web pages, but used in many non-browser environments as well such as node.js or Apache CouchDB. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. Read more about JavaScript.

they also have a nice introduction to JavaScript section: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide

Mozilla Developer Network
JavaScript Guide
The JavaScript Guide shows you how to use JavaScript and gives an overview of the language. If you want to get started with JavaScript or programming in general, consult the articles in the learning area. If you need exhaustive information about a language feature, have a look at the JavaScript reference.

and the chrome console is the place to live and it can be much friendlier with these tips and tricks: https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks

Ben's lecture Tuesday pm:

var variableName defines a variable. If we don't use var, then JS will look up through the function tree until it finds an existing variable with that name, and create a global variable if none exists. That makes it wise to always use var when declaring variables.

function creates scope, and that's the only thing that defines scope. Except maybe for loops?!

Constructor pattern:

```
function Dog() {
  this.name = 'Barney';
  this.bark = function() {
    return 'Bark!';
  }
}
```

```dog = new Dog
dog.bark()
=> "Bark!"
dog.name
=> "Barney"
```
